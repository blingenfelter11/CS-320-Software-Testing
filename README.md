#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

In order to ensure that the code, program, or software that I am working on is functional and secure, I will put checks at every stage of development. Starting by choosing the programming language and framework that works best based on the requirements of the project. Next, by choosing a secure environment that reinforfes security best practices. The, by automating processes that can make security easier to adopt.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are what we base our requirements on. We use the systems requirements to design what functionality the program needs to solve the user needs and how to best provide solutionsto those needs. To incorrporate the needs into the program we collect the needs and assess if the functionality requirements we built for the program solves the user needs.

#How do I approach designing software?

The main approach to designing software I have learned this far is object oriented design. This design strategy focuses on entities and their characteristics. Objects are the entities involved in the designs. Classes define all the attributes and methods define the functionality of the object. To design a program we would start with creating our requirements. Next, we would identify the objects and group them into classes based on attribute characteristics. Then, we define a class heirarchy and relation among them. Finally, we would build off this frame work to complete the program.
